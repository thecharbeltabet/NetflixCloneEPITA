# NetflixCloneEPITA

The Netflix clone is a web-based application that allows users to browse and stream movies. 
The frontend is built with React, a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
The two microservices that support the application are built with Node.js and Java Spring Boot, both widely-used and robust backend technologies.
The Node.js and MongoDB microservice manages the movie ratings, while the Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL microservice handles user authentication and movie data. 
These two microservices work together to provide a seamless and responsive experience for users, and to ensure the efficient and reliable management of movie ratings, user data, and movie information.
The Netflix clone is designed to provide a high-quality streaming service for users, while maintaining the security and privacy of their data.

It is built by Charbel Tabet to fulfill the requirements of several courses at EPITA in the masters of Software Engineering
